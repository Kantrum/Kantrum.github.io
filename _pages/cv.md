RESEARCH PROJECTS
======
Recognition and reconstruction of the elements in scanned page, Jan 2023 â€“ Mar 2023
_Team Leader; Advisor: Prof. JosÃ© Miguel HernÃ¡ndez-Lobato, University of Cambridge_
  * Utilized the PaddleOCR library, employing the DBnet model for text detection with a precision of **96%** and a recall of **94%**.
  * Applied the Mask R-CNN model and LayoutParser toolkit for layout analysis, successfully identifying and classifying page elements with **95%** accuracy across **1,500** multi-format documents.
  * This approach was tested on a dataset of **10,000** images containing distorted and low-resolution text, where it maintained an accuracy rate of **97%**.

Research on Driver fatigue monitoring System based on machine learning, Aug 2022 â€“ Jun 2023
_Individual Project; Advisor: Prof. Yi Zhang, Southwest Jiaotong University_
  * Developed a comprehensive machine learning system, employing **10+** algorithms which were rigorously tested, resulting in a system performance enhancement of **15%** over baseline models.
  * Engineered and integrated four robust functional modules handling over **500 GB** of data across the pipeline stages of data collection, preprocessing (achieving **99.5%** data integrity), feature extraction (isolating **50+** key features with a selection accuracy rate of **98%**), and machine learning.
  * Executed over **200** experiments on driver fatigue detection, reaching **95%** accuracy and outperforming previous models by **20%**.

In-vehicle driver health monitoring and alarming system (National Project), Apr 2022 â€“ may 2023
_Team Leader; Advisor: Prof. Yi Zhang, Southwest Jiaotong University_
  * Implemented real-time transmitters that monitor in-vehicle temperature and CO2 levels, maintainingenvironmental parameters within **5%** of optimal conditions to ensure driver alertness.
  * Developed non-contact fabric electrodes for ECG signal collection, capturing cardiac activity with a signal fidelity of **97%**, enabling the detection of subtle physiological changes indicative of fatigue.

Data collection and processing based on Python and Wi-Fi, Apr 2021 â€“ May 2022
_Team Leader; Advisor: Prof. Yongzhi Jing, Southwest Jiaotong University_
  * Directed a specialized team of three, leading to the successful completion of the project **20%** ahead ofschedule, with a track record of **100%** adherence to progress milestones.
  * Implemented a Python-based TCP interactive data collection system, achieving a data transmission reliability of **99.5%** between senders and receivers.
  * Enhanced voice signal clarity using a Deep Clustering algorithm, resulting in a **30%** improvement in the segregation of overlapping speech signals and boosting the accuracy of voice frequency extraction.
