Meet Jiongtao Huang (Simon, é»„ç‚¯æ¶›), an ambitious and multifaceted individual.

Iâ€™m currently pursuing my degree in Electronic and Electrical Engineering at the University of Leeds and Southwest Jiaotong University (SWJTU-Leeds Joint School). My academic journey is complemented by my entrepreneurial spirit, as I am the founder of Sichuan Jie Min Technology Co., Ltd. and Hunan Chuangben Technology Co., Ltd..

In addition to my academic and entrepreneurial endeavors, I actively contribute to student life as a member of the Student Campus Self-Management Committee at SWJTU. I also hold the distinction of being the menâ€™s 100m record holder in the general student group at Southwest Jiaotong University, a testament to my dedication and versatility.

If you are interested in any aspect of me, I would love to chat and collaborate, please email me at - kantrum@163.com
