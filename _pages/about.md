    <h2 class="section-title">Welcome to My Personal Space</h2>
    <div class="justify-text">
        <p>Hello there! I'm Jiongtao Huang, but you can call me Karen. I'm navigating the exciting world of the Electrical and Computer Engineering at Cornell University. It's a journey that blends my love for technology with an itch to explore and create.</p>
        <p>My academic path is just one slice of the pie. I've dipped my toes in the waters of entrepreneurship, founding Sichuan Jie Min Technology Co., Ltd. and Hunan Chuangben Technology Co., Ltd. These ventures are my playgrounds for innovation, where I learn, stumble, and grow.</p>
        <p>But wait, there's more! At SWJTU, I'm not just another face in the crowd. As a member of the Student Campus Self-Management Committee, I dive into enriching student life, bringing a dash of energy and a spoonful of ideas. Oh, and did I mention I sprint? Yep, I'm the guy who set the men’s 100m record in the general student group at Southwest Jiaotong University. It's not just about speed; it's about passion, persistence, and a little bit of playful competition.</p>
        <p>Curious about any of me? I'm always up for a good chat or a collaborative brainstorm. Reach out to me at <a href="mailto:kantrum@163.com">kantrum@163.com</a>, and let's see what interesting ideas we can cook up together!</p>

This place is more than just a display of my personal achievements and milestones; it's a space for documenting and sharing my journey of growth.</p>
    <p>Here, you can find my academic papers, project works, entrepreneurial stories, and my reflections on life.

Whether you are a teacher, student, colleague, or just someone curious about my work and life, I welcome you to share your thoughts, experiences, and insights with me.</p>
    <p>Through this website, I aim not only to showcase who I was but also to explore who I might become. It is a constantly evolving platform, reflecting my journey of change and growth. I look forward to meeting you on this journey and sharing, learning, and growing together.</p>
