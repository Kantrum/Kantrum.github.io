    <h2>Welcome to My Personal Space: A Mosaic of My Life and Aspirations!</h2>
    <p>Meet Jiongtao Huang (Simon, 黄炯涛), an ambitious and multifaceted individual.</p>
    <p>I’m currently pursuing my degree in Electronic and Electrical Engineering at the University of Leeds and Southwest Jiaotong University (SWJTU-Leeds Joint School). My academic journey is complemented by my entrepreneurial spirit, as I am the founder of Sichuan Jie Min Technology Co., Ltd. and Hunan Chuangben Technology Co., Ltd..</p>
    <p>In addition to my academic and entrepreneurial endeavors, I actively contribute to student life as a member of the Student Campus Self-Management Committee at SWJTU. I also hold the distinction of being the men’s 100m record holder in the general student group at Southwest Jiaotong University, a testament to my dedication and versatility.</p>
    <p>If you are interested in any aspect of me, I would love to chat and collaborate, please email me at - <a href="mailto:kantrum@163.com">kantrum@163.com</a></p>
