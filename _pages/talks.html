<h2>RESEARCH PROJECTS</h2>
<p><strong>Recognition and reconstruction of the elements in scanned page, Jan 2023 – Mar 2023</strong><br>
<em>Team Leader; Advisor: Prof. José Miguel Hernández-Lobato, University of Cambridge</em>
<ul>
  <li>Utilized the PaddleOCR library, employing the DBnet model for text detection with a precision of <strong>96%</strong> and a recall of <strong>94%</strong>.</li>
  <li>Applied the Mask R-CNN model and LayoutParser toolkit for layout analysis, successfully identifying and classifying page elements with <strong>95%</strong> accuracy across <strong>1,500</strong> multi-format documents.</li>
  <li>This approach was tested on a dataset of <strong>10,000</strong> images containing distorted and low-resolution text, where it maintained an accuracy rate of <strong>97%</strong>.</li>
