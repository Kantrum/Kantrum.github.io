With the continuous progress of modern technology, the application of intelligent and automated technology has achieved remarkable results in various fields, however, in the field of pigeon rearing, the application of such technology is still relatively limited. Therefore, we decided to introduce intelligent technology into pigeon breeding to create an intelligent pigeon breeding system. We hope that through the integration of advanced sensors, automation equipment and intelligent algorithms, we can solve all the problems existing in the traditional rearing methods, improve the management efficiency of the breeders and provide a better rearing experience.
