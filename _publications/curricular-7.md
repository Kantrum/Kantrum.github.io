**Outline:** 
***Section 1: Introduction***
The presentation explores semiconductor technologies, focusing on light-emitting diodes (LEDs), laser technologies, and their applications.

***Section 2: LED Technology - Light Fidelity (Li-Fi)***
Introduction to the latest LED technology: Light Fidelity (Li-Fi), used in visible light wireless communication.  
Material science advancements: Gallium-nitride based semiconductors enable higher operating frequencies for Li-Fi.  
Li-Fi Advantages: Compatibility with WiFi technology, energy efficiency, quality of service, and no interference with WiFi.  
Li-Fi Limitations: Need for LEDs to remain on for data transmission, susceptibility to interference from sunlight.  

***Section 3: Terahertz Technology***
Introduction to terahertz technology as a transformative scientific field.  
Role of Quantum Cascade Lasers (QCL) in terahertz research.  
Advantages: Penetration through opaque materials, safety for organisms, utility in biomedicine, and specific frequency applications.  
Application: Leeds team's breakthrough in climate research using QCL in satellite programs.  
Challenges: Limited availability of terahertz radiation sources, technical and cost barriers, difficulties in interaction with terahertz frequency range. 

***Section 4: Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) of LED and Terahertz Devices***
TRL for LED: Assessed at level 8 due to its maturity, safety, longevity, and efficiency.  
TRL for Terahertz Devices: Rated at level 5, considering the high cost, limited civilian use, and experimental stage in medical applications.  
Discussion on challenges in advancing through TRL stages, particularly from levels 3 to 4 and 7 to 8.  

***Section 5: Conclusion and References***
Summary of topics covered: Li-Fi technology, terahertz technology, and their respective TRLs.  
Acknowledgment and references.
