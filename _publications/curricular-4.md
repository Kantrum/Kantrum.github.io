**Introduction:** Our Buggy Project is an innovative endeavor combining engineering and creativity to build a remote-controlled car. The project's heart lies in its motor, wheels, and bracket, with a special focus on the M6513 Motor. We've integrated a sophisticated Bluetooth module board, enabling remote operation through a custom-designed control unit with multiple buttons. The project's technical finesse is showcased in the construction of an H Bridge, initially prototyped on a breadboard and later refined through the integration of the Bluetooth module's slave part for controlling GPIO outputs. The soldering of these components onto the circuit board was a meticulous process, requiring precision and care. A unique addition to our buggy is a metal-constructed tank head, ingeniously designed to achieve 360-degree rotation. This feature, powered by an external motor and gear drive, not only enhances the functionality but also adds an element of distinctiveness to our design.

Here's a recording of our Buggy!
