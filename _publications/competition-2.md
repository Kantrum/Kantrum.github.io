**I. Product Description**  
Ruiyuan is a new energy vehicle inspection system that monitors and evaluates the health status of electric vehicles in real time by collecting, transmitting and analysing their operating data. Based on big data analysis technology and artificial intelligence algorithms, the system is capable of comprehensively monitoring and evaluating electric vehicles, providing users with accurate inspection reports and health assessments. It mainly involves the testing of battery system, motor system and transmission system, including the measurement of battery capacity, health and charging status, motor speed and torque, transmission efficiency, transmission shaft speed and other parameters.  

**II. Customer Groups**  
Ruiyuan's target users are new energy vehicle manufacturers, after-sales service organisations and vehicle owners. For new energy vehicle manufacturers and after-sales service organisations, RESET provides comprehensive testing and evaluation functions to help them ensure the safety, performance and reliability of new energy vehicles, and to meet the requirements of regulations and standards. For vehicle owners, Reynolds provides real-time monitoring and assessment of the health status of electric vehicles, helping them to understand the health status of their vehicles and ensure driving safety and reliability.  

**III. Project Vision**  
Ruiyuan's vision is to become a leading inspection technology provider in the new energy vehicle industry, offering comprehensive inspection and assessment solutions for the safety, performance and reliability of new energy vehicles. By combining big data analysis technology and artificial intelligence algorithms, Ruiyuan is committed to providing users with accurate and efficient inspection reports and health assessments to help them better understand and manage the health of their electric vehicles, and to enhance their experience and confidence.  

**IV. Competitors**  
In the field of new energy vehicle inspection technology, Ruiyuan faces a number of competitors. Among them, some traditional automotive testing equipment and system providers have also started to get involved in the field of new energy vehicle testing, and the competitive pressure is gradually increasing. In addition, some companies focusing on battery management systems and electric vehicle diagnostic technology may also become competitors. The competitive advantage of Ryan lies in its comprehensive testing and evaluation capabilities, as well as its efficient analysis algorithms based on big data and artificial intelligence, which can provide more accurate and comprehensive testing reports and health assessments to meet the diverse needs of users.  

Through the new energy vehicle inspection system of Ruiyuan, users can keep abreast of the health status of electric vehicles and anticipate potential problems in advance so as to take appropriate maintenance and repair measures to ensure the safety and reliability of electric vehicles. The goal of Ruiyuan is to become a trusted brand in the field of new energy vehicles, provide users with high-quality inspection technology and a full range of after-sales service, and promote the sustainable development of new energy vehicles.
