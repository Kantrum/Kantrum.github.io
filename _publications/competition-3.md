Unloading Pro Team, a team focusing on researching intelligent loading and unloading solutions for **unmanned delivery vehicles**, aims to provide a series of intelligent loading and unloading products including intelligent loading and unloading devices and information management system for unmanned delivery vehicles under **multi-application scenarios** and with different needs, which are customised according to the needs and are ready to be used on demand, and to provide them with intelligent, efficient and safe unmanned loading and unloading services to help unmanned delivery vehicles to really achieve "unmanned".  

The team proposes the core product based on unmanned loading and unloading technology - **HandsFree** intelligent loading and unloading device and its control system. The product's use customers are major unmanned vehicle manufacturers, assembled inside the unmanned vehicle to serve enterprises or individuals with distribution logistics needs. Compared with current loading and unloading devices, this product has obvious advantages in terms of economy, space utilisation and efficiency. The product was developed by the team with the support of **the State Local Joint Engineering Laboratory of Integrated Transportation Intelligence located in Southwest Jiaotong University**. At present, this product has passed **the preliminary debugging**, with strong technical innovation and universality, and signed a commissioned production and sales agreement with Chongqing Tesco Technology Co. Ltd  

This product to unmanned loading and unloading as the target market, in-depth excavation of the current unmanned distribution vehicles can not be autonomous loading and unloading of the pain points, proposed and implemented including intelligent loading and unloading equipment and its control system HandsFree - intelligent loading and unloading solutions for unmanned distribution vehicles vehicles vehicles intelligent loading and unloading program, initially through the cooperation with the Chongqing Municipal Tesco Technology Co., Ltd. to sign an agreement to entrust its production and sales of products, and share part of the profits from product sales, gradually establish brand influence, create an independent production system and sales channels, access to customer resources, relying on advanced products and technology, integration and unmanned distribution-related resources, to create an integrated intelligent logistics ecosystem. The product divides the target market into community distribution, warehouse shop distribution, and factory distribution, and the market scale is expected to reach **8343.82 billion yuan**.  

The product is expected to be financed at **RMB 1,927,400,000** and to achieve a cumulative total operating income (excluding tax) of **RMB 77,060,000,000** within five years of commissioning. With the continuous development of the product, it is expected to be able to have strong operational capability within three years of being put into use, and become a well-known brand with significant influence in the field of intelligent loading and unloading within five years of being put into use.
