The project focuses on developing a "lab pack" application designed to assist engineering beginners, particularly those in the SWJTU-Leeds joint school, with their laboratory sessions. The application aims to reduce the complexity of calculations involved in engineering fields and enhance students' enthusiasm and understanding of various engineering concepts.

The first feature of the application is a matrix calculator, which is a crucial tool in various engineering fields, especially in electrical and electronic engineering. This calculator is intended to simplify the process of solving linear equation sets, which are common in circuit analysis involving resistive-inductive-capacitive circuits. Additionally, the matrix calculator can be used in communication engineering for analyzing system failures, particularly through the application of hamming code in data transmission.

The second feature is a filter calculator, designed to aid beginners in learning about different types of filters and assisting in the selection of component values for filter construction. The program includes various filter types, such as low pass, high pass, band pass, band stop, and Sallen-Key filters. This feature is particularly useful in educational and practical fields, where filters are frequently needed in circuits. The calculator simplifies the process of determining component values, saving time and reducing the risk of errors in manual calculations.

The final module of the application focuses on calculations for Step-down Buck and Step-up Boost converters. This feature is targeted at electrical engineers, helping them design DC-DC converters based on specific requirements, such as voltage ripple and current ripple, and hardware constraints. It allows engineers to precisely calculate properties of current and voltage in a circuit based on the given topology and component values.

In summary, this "lab pack" application serves as a comprehensive tool for engineering students and professionals, simplifying complex calculations and enhancing understanding in various engineering disciplines. The calculator is not only limited to the features described but also offers additional functions to explore and apply in real-world engineering scenarios.
