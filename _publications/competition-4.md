The tile-level wireless energy transfer product based on multi-stage magnetic resonance coupled insulators will be developed through research and development of multi-stage magnetic resonance coupled insulator wireless energy transfer technology and devices, and joint optimisation of miniaturisation, effective power supply distance and high efficiency to form a small size and efficient wireless energy transfer prototype system. This will improve the long-term operational reliability of the transmission and distribution line condition monitoring system and support the digital transformation of the power grid and the construction of the energy internet.  

The product is divided into three main sections: research on multi-stage magnetic resonance coupling enhanced wireless energy transfer technology, research on multi-stage magnetic resonance module high voltage insulator structure design and packaging technology, and research on tower-side sensing application technology based on multi-stage magnetic resonance coupling wireless energy transfer.  

Panel I includes the modelling and simulation of multi-stage magnetic resonance coupled wireless energy transfer system and the study of efficiency enhancement method, and the construction of coil model and circuit model of multi-stage magnetic resonance coupled wireless energy transfer system, the completion of the simulation analysis of the system electrical parameters transmission performance, and the verification of the feasibility of the transmission performance enhancement method. Panel 2 includes the design of insulation package structure, simulation and optimisation of electric field distribution characteristics of insulation structure and development and testing of multi-stage magnetic resonance module integrated device, forming the implementation plan of integrated insulation package such as material selection, process control and processing, and exploring the influence of insulation package and insulation structure on the energy transfer efficiency of multi-stage magnetic resonance module. Panel III includes the application of multi-stage magnetic resonance coupled wireless energy transfer system in overhead line scenario Based on the development of multi-stage magnetic resonance coupled wireless energy transfer application system, the application system performance trial and testing and field verification, the analysis of the power supply demand of sensors on the tower side of transmission and distribution poles was completed, and the study of the application scheme and deployment scheme design of wireless energy transfer system on the tower side of transmission and distribution poles were completed.  

In terms of business model, this product proposes to carry out research and development of tile-level wireless energy transfer technology and device based on multi-stage magnetic resonance coupled insulators, based on the existing technical research results, to carry out joint optimisation in terms of miniaturisation, effective power supply distance and high efficiency to form a small size and efficient wireless energy transfer prototype system. This will enable the combination of technical breakthroughs and practical applications, providing new reliable power supply solutions and devices for tower-side cameras, wireless concentrators, dragon nests and other tile-level equipment, thus improving the long-term operational reliability of transmission and distribution line condition monitoring systems and supporting the digital transformation of power grids and the construction of the energy internet.
