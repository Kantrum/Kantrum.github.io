**Task:**  
Unit 4 is the final step in the module and is an individual mini-project that will run over a period of 8 weeks (including the Easter Holiday). You will be able to apply your enhanced C++ skills to create an embedded systems-based game that, as a minimum requirement, must use the ST Nucleo-L476RG development board, joystick and LCD. However, you may extend the range of peripheral devices you use by adding devices like switches, LEDs, etc., or you might even be more ambitious and use I2C or SPI-based modules such as an accelerometer. Please note that if you choose to use peripheral devices that are not supported in the labs, you will have to purchase them yourself, as there is no budget allocated for the mini-project. Additionally, you will be responsible for coding and porting any required drivers onto the ST development board - lab tutors will have very limited time to provide assistance with this, other than to provide guidance. Furthermore, you can use 'CoolTerm' or the built-in serial communications monitor in Mbed Studio as an input/output i.e. a terminal to enable further interaction with your game through a PC/laptop keyboard/monitor.

Apart from the need to utilise the ST development board, joystick, and LCD, the game specification is open and driven by your area of interest and your skill level. In the past, students have created basic Arcade games such as Snake, Asteroids, Breakout, and Copter, which were built on the Pong game engine (example code provided). Some went even further and developed complex 3D games such as dungeon crawlers and a Star Wars-inspired X-Wing missing game, which is still one of the most impressive games submitted in the module.



**My Project:**  
My project involves the development of a washing machine control panel with two primary control modes: fully automatic and manual adjustment. The panel is designed with various components including buttons, indicators, a timer display window, sensors, a thermistor, and a buzzer. The buttons are for power, start, confirmation, and return, while the indicators show the process status. The panel also includes a pressure sensor, water temperature sensor, and a photoresistor.

In the fully automatic mode, the washing machine operates through a sequence of steps starting from powering on, checking sensor readings, selecting the wash cycle, and executing the wash process. This mode automates the washing process, including water inlet, washing, draining, and spinning, and employs various sensors to ensure safe operation. If the machine detects an overload or high temperature, it pauses and alerts the user with the buzzer. The user can also pause the machine manually during the process.

The manual adjustment mode allows more control over the washing process. After starting up and sensor checks, users can manually select the wash cycle and the specific operation they want the machine to perform, such as water inlet, washing, draining, or spinning. This mode also incorporates safety features similar to the automatic mode and allows for manual pausing of the wash cycle.

The design of the control panel involves programming and microcontroller utilization. Key programming concepts applied include the use of loops, conditional statements, and functions in C++. The project integrates knowledge of digital signal outputs, potentiometer use, and serial outputs to control various components of the washing machine, like LEDs and sensors. A significant part of the design process involved troubleshooting and debugging to ensure smooth operation of the control interface.

The presentation of the project demonstrates the functionality of the washing machine panel, including mode selection, process execution, and sensor operations. It highlights the interaction between different components and the overall user experience. Additionally, the project includes a status interface that communicates parameters and button presses to a computer.

Reflecting on the project, the developer discusses the learning experience, emphasizing the importance of programming skills, especially in C++. The project required a comprehensive understanding of microcontroller inputs and outputs, as well as effective use of programming constructs like loops and conditionals. Challenges faced during development, such as debugging and code optimization, provided valuable lessons in problem-solving and programming proficiency.
